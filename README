A static routing algorithm for MCENoC networks implemented by UoB on the EMC2
project.

See the --help for details on running the program.

A modified Sa-TikZ library, *switching-architectures* is used to generate the
network images used in this tool. See https://github.com/stevekerrison/Sa-TikZ

The location of this TikZ library must be in your TEXINPUTS envvar in order to
run pdflatex/similar.

The routing algorithm is based on the work of A. Waksman, "A Permutation
Network," Journal of the ACM, vol. 15, pp. 159â€“163, Jan. 1968.
